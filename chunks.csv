"**Abstract**

*   **Object Detection and Recognition Importance**
    *   Object detection and recognition are important problems in computer vision.

*   **Challenges in Object Detection**
    *   Since these problems are meta-heuristic, despite a lot of research, practically usable, intelligent, real-time, and dynamic object detection/recognition methods are still unavailable.

*   **Proposed Solution**
    *   We propose a new object detection/recognition method, which improves over the existing methods in every stage of the object detection/recognition process.

*   **Geometric Features**
    *   In addition to the usual features, we propose to use geometric shapes, like linear cues, ellipses and quadrangles, as additional features.

*   **Exploiting Geometric Cues**
    *   The full potential of geometric cues is exploited by using them to extract other features in a robust, computationally efficient, and less meta-heuristic manner.

*   **Hierarchical Codebook**
    *   We also propose a new hierarchical codebook, which provides good generalization and discriminative properties.

*   **Codebook Capabilities**
    *   The codebook enables fast multi-path inference mechanisms based on propagation of conditional likelihoods, which make it robust to occlusion and noise. It has the capability of dynamic learning."
"**Abstract**

Everyone has an elder person to care about (grandparent, neighbor, ...etc.), and we all see the difficulties elder people face in everyday normal life actives because of their health conditions.

**Monitoring Elder's Health**

As we know, elder people's health state need to be monitored by some companion (like hospital staff), who might not be able to handle The elder's successive needs while keeping track of their important vital signals and critical health cases like detecting coma while sleeping, fall detection, etc...

**Our Role**

Our role is to apply modern technologies and combine different tools with low cost to help elder people in different aspects of their lives, so we help both the elderly and their companions.

**Project Overview**

This paper represents a project consisting of two parts, the first one is attached to the elder 's body, and the other is inside the elder's room.

**Beginning of Project**

The first part begins with the room entrance as we use NodeMCU and PIR senor to control door motion, as the door opens automatically, the room is lit, the elder can control room lightning as he/she wishes, and when the elder sleeps, the system accurately detects sleep coma by monitoring his/her motion while sleep and notify companions if there is something wrong."

## **Privacy and Personal Data**
Privacy is the ability to manage who can access data regarding our private lives and activities. Privacy is very important because it protects our information that we do not wish to be shared publicly (such as health, personal finances or personal documents) and gives us the power to choose who to share it with. It can even help protect our physical safety (for example, if our real time location data is crucial and needs to be kept secret).

## **Challenges to Privacy**
But in the recent years, our personal data is not really under our full control, as personal data is collected, stored, and may be shared with others without our consent. Many of our activities leave trails of our data. This includes making phone calls, making transactions using credit cards, GPS detecting and tracking our locations, and sharing your identity documents with a bank for applying for a loan. This becomes particularly problematic when our data is shared with other companies, or a security breach allows unauthorized access to our data.

## **Data Breaches and Identity Management**
According to the Breach Level Index, almost 15 billion data records have been exposed since 2013. Most of the identity management systems currently in use are weak and cannot provide enough privacy and security. In this project we have designed and implemented an identity management system that capitalizes on the blockchain technology to allow the user to have full control over his identity documents.

## **System Functionality**
Our system provides an easy to use user interface that allows the user to upload his documents (using IPFS), and also respond to requests to view his documents. A company in the system (a bank, for example) can add a request to view a user's document, and can view the document itself once the user accepts the request.

## **Introduction**
Automated fracture detection is an essential part of the computer-aided telemedicine system. Fractures in human bones often occur due to accidental injuries such as slipping. In fact, many hospitals lack experienced surgeons to diagnose fractures. Therefore, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) reduces the burden on clinicians and identifies the fracture. We present a new classification network, a fracture-sensitive convolutional neural network (**DenseNet**), that is sensitive to fracture lines. In this paper we propose a new two-stage system for fracture detection. 

## **Method**
First, we use the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to discover the data set consisting of 14,863 studies from 12,173 patients, totaling 40,561 multi-vision radiographs. Each belongs to one of seven standard types for radiographic study of the upper extremities:
*   elbow
*   finger
*   forearm
*   hand
*   humerus
*   shoulder
*   wrist
Then we realize if each area of the bone is broken using **DenseNet**.

## **Evaluation**
We evaluate the performance of our proposed system using X-ray images from the Mura dataset, achieving an accuracy of 79%. The next step we try to develop the model to achieve the highest accuracy and lowest error rate."

**Introduction**
Visually and hearing-impaired people face troubles due to inaccessible infrastructure and social challenges in daily life. To increase the life quality of those people, we report a portable and user-friendly smartphone-based platform capable of generating captions and text descriptions, using image obtained from a smartphone camera.

**Image Captioning**
Image captioning is to generate a sentence to describe the visual content of an image in natural language and has attracted an increasing amount of attention in the fields of computer vision and natural language processing due to its potential applications. Generating image captions with proper linguistic properties is a challenging task as it needs to combine advanced level of image understanding algorithms with natural language processing methods, also we add the option to ask question about this captured photo like what the color of the ball is? and so on.

**Proposed Method**
In this study, we propose to use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to generate a caption after images are trained using Visual Attention architecture. The visual attributes of images are extracted with the Inception version 3, which conveys richer content, and then they are fed into the LSTM model for caption generation. also propose the task of free-form and open-ended Visual Question Answering (VQA). Given an image and a natural language question about the image, the task is to provide an accurate natural language answer. Mirroring real-world scenarios, such as helping the visually impaired, both the questions and answers are open-ended. Visual questions selectively target different areas of an image, including background details and underlying context. As a result, a system that succeeds at VQA typically needs a more detailed understanding of the image and complex reasoning than a system producing generic image captions.

**System Integration**
These systems are integrated with our custom designed Android application, named as ""Sight"" which transfers the images from smartphone to the remote server via a cloud system and displays the captions after the images are processed with the proposed captioning approach.

**Results**
The results show that the integrated platform has great potential to be used for image captioning by visually and hearing-impaired people with advantages such as portability, simple operation, and rapid response."

**Introduction**
Lung cancer is a sort of dangerous cancer and difficult to detect. It usually causes death for both gender men & women therefore, so it is more necessary for care to immediately & correctly examine nodules. Accordingly, several techniques have been implemented to detect lung cancer in the early stages like SVM, Decision Trees, CNN and K Nearest Neighbour.

**CNN Architecture**
In This Project we implemented a CNN architecture based on Scientific papers we found that that CNN is recommended as a high classification technique in image classification domain. The detection is based on CT image, and it's based on a lot of studies it has been found that CT scan images are more suitable to have the accurate results. Therefore, mostly CT scan images are used for detection of cancer.

**Website Application**
Our project is a website application. It enables you to upload a CT scan of a lung you need to detect if it's a cancerous lung or not.

## **Introduction**
Sketch-based Realistic Image Generation consists of two models with different architectures (Composition-Aided Gan and Multi-Adversarial Networks), that aims to convert sketch images to realistic images which can be useful in many cases like helping police to recognize criminals by converting their sketch to real image.

## **Problem Statement**
Many of the existing methods' results have blurred effects and deformation in some facial components so it's a challenge to generate high-quality and realistic synthesized images, that's why CA-Gan uses P-net to extract the main facial components to help in image synthesize, calculate the compositional reconstruction loss to focus training on hard generated components and calculate the perceptual loss to encourage the generated and the real images to have the same identity and to be perceptually similar.

## **Synthesis Challenges**
Synthesizing real photos from face sketches and its inverse have many applications. However, photo/sketch synthesis remains a challenging problem due to the fact that photo and sketch have different characteristics.

## **Proposed Solution**
we consider this task as an image-to-image translation problem and explore the recently popular generative models (GANs) to generate high-quality realistic photos from sketches.

we implement Photo-Sketch Synthesis using Multi-Adversarial Networks, (PS2-MAN) that iteratively generates low resolution to high resolution images in an adversarial way. The hidden layers of the generator are supervised to first generate lower resolution images followed by implicit refinement in the network to generate higher resolution images.

## **Experimental Results**
After doing a total of 9 experiments, being discussed in chapter 5 we decreased the best previous Fr'echet Inception distance (FID) from 60.9 to 50.8 for colored pictures, and to 55.3 for gray-scare pictures.

**Describing Images with Sentences**
Being able to automatically describe the content of an image using properly formed English sentences is a challenging task, but it could have a great impact by helping visually impaired people better understand their surroundings. Most modern mobile phones can capture photographs, making it possible for the visually impaired to make images of their environments. These images can then be used to generate captions that can be read out loud to the visually impaired, so we need to caption and annotate the image by using Inception V3, Attention Mechanisms, and GRU, and CNN.

**Image Captioning Process**
Users upload/capture an image to get the image caption, to extract features from the image, we will use inception V3. The image feature extracted is used by the CNN and sentence is generated by GRU along with attention mechanisms to generate formed English sentence.

**Application Development**
So, in our project, we developed an application that can caption an image and read it out loud to the user to help him."

As a result, we put the objective of creating a self-driving delivery car to help in decreasing the number of car's accidents and to help in having a better and safer delivery process.

## **Self-Driving Delivery Car**
So, we chose to build a self-driving delivery car, where its mission is to autonomously deliver items from a specific area to another without the need of any drivers. This is done by fusing artificial intelligence models to the video streaming of the car, and training some models to detect and recognize all the surroundings around the car to make it able to make good decisions like humans.

## **Sensors and Control**
A combination of sensors fusion and advanced perception and control methods have been applied in order to achieve the efficient self driving as the car can dodge obstacles, able to move on the road while staying on its lane lines boundaries, detect if there are pedestrians crossing in front of it, furthermore detect and recognize traffic signs and traffic lights.

## **Delivery Mobile Application**
A delivery mobile application was implemented, so that through it the client can make his orders and the destination will be sent to the car to follow, and then QR-Code will be sent to the client so he can scan it on the car and get his order.

## **Conclusion**
After finishing the thesis, it is proven that using the new technologies in the right place helps improve people's life, and as we can conclude that each person holding the power of knowledge, must use it for the good of humanity."

**Breast Cancer Overview**

Breast cancer is the second most common cause of death for women, as it affects one out of twelve women, and some men also get it, but it is more common among women. Breast Cancer is considered to be the second dangerous kind of cancers according to statistics that were made by the health world organization. Cancer cells are immature and immortal, refusing to die when they are supposed to. They damage the tissues and organs. In a different way, cancer cells are selfish, borrowing resources from the nearby cells. In time, sometimes these cells also spread to other tissues nearby through the blood and lymph nodes, which becomes metastasis.

**Importance of Awareness and Early Detection**

There is a great lack of awareness among women about the seriousness of this disease and the ways of early detection of it to increase the rates of recovery. Therefore, raising awareness and early detection may provide a great journey of suffering from treatment. Breast Cancer Detection project It is, in short, a project for preserving the health of women and girls because it is a project about Breast cancer, as it can predict malignant and benign breast cancer in its four intensity stages using mammography images Which can detect breast cancer three years earlier, which makes the cure rate much higher, and it also provides enough information to increase women's awareness of the danger of this disease.

**Application Results**

The final results that we have obtained are an application that predicts breast cancer if it is benign or malignant, and what is its density, is it density 1 or 2 or 3 or 4. It also provides advice and support to women and how to do a monthly breast examination to ensure the safety of its health, and the information that every woman needs to become sufficiently aware of this disease."

**Internet of Things - IoT**

Internet of Things - IoT, a newly emerging term that means the new generation of Internet (network) that allows for understanding between interconnected devices (via Internet Protocol). These devices include various tools, sensors, sensors and AI tools, among others. This definition goes beyond the traditional concept of people communicating with computers and smartphones via one global network and through the well-known traditional Internet Protocol. What distinguishes the Internet of Things is that it allows a person to be free from the place, meaning that the person can control the tools without having to be in a specific place to deal with a specific device.

**Mobile Application**

A mobile application, also referred to as a mobile app or simply an app, is a computer program or software application designed to run on a mobile device such as a phone, tablet, or watch. Apps were originally intended for productivity assistance such as email, calendar, and contact databases, but the public demand for apps caused rapid expansion into other areas such as mobile games, factory automation, GPS and location-based services, order-tracking, and ticket purchases, so that there are now millions of apps available. Apps are generally downloaded from application distribution platforms which are operated by the owner of the mobile operating system, such as the App Store (iOS) or Google Play Store. Some apps are free, and others have a price, with the profit being split between the application's creator and the distribution platform."

**Introduction**
As the advancements in computer graphics and virtual reality increase, capturing accurate representations of real-world objects and scenes has become a necessity. Thus, the problem of reconstructing 3D models from image data emerged. 3D reconstruction is the procedure of converting various signals - commonly 2D images - into 3D models.

**Applications and Challenges**
Some of the applications of 3D reconstruction are photogrammetry, robotic mapping, and game character design. 3D reconstruction poses a challenge because the real-world objects were originally captured in 3D, however, the 3rd dimension was lost during the capturing process. We target the use of 3D reconstruction techniques in the generation of 3D game characters given rough sketches of single or multiple views of the character. We use pix2pix GAN to effectively generate depth maps of the 3D model from multiple views which are translated to point clouds and reconstructed into a 3D mesh."

**Role of Multiple Choice Questions**
Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) play a major role in the educational assessment as well as in active learning. The effectiveness of MCQs and their ability to evaluate fairly on the understanding of a student in various topics and determine his level in a short time has been proven.

**Generating Questions**
Generating a huge number of questions with meaningful choices manually requires a lot of time and effort. So, we aim to develop a system that uses natural language processing techniques to generate Multiple Choice Questions automatically from text to save time and effort of instructors and help students measure their knowledge.

**Project Overview**
In this project we present a system that generates MCQs automatically using a generic domain text as input. The three main functions are Keyword Selection, Sentence Extraction, and Distractors Generation (Distractors: refer to wrong options). The system generates four types of questions: 
* Gap-fill Question
* WH-Question including (what, where, when & who)
* True or False Question
* Yes or No Question

**Keyword Selection and Sentence Rearrangement**
All the sentences in a text are not capable of generating questions, so we select keywords in a body of text by analyzing the frequency of word appearance and its co-occurrence with other words in the text and, using natural language processing techniques such as named entity recognition which used to determine the informative sentences that contain each of these keywords. And applying part of speech to rearrange the sentence parts to form question sentences properly, finally, distractors are generated using wordnet to get the closest words related to the keyword."

**The Evolution of Programming Languages**

The concept of programming and traditional programming languages has arrived to a peak that all its developing is around the same point of making an easier language or providing more features.

**Challenges in Computer Science Education**

This leads to Computer Science students being uncertain about what to learn, also limit their knowledge to a limited number of fields that may be one at the end.

**Machine Learning and Code Generation**

The idea of having a Machine learning model that can convert the user's description into its corresponding running line of code is like a revolution on the traditional programming languages that require the knowledge of each language's specific syntax making it harder for a programmer to have experience in a group of programming fields.

**Abstraction in Programming**

Having something that can help abstract the programming idea using the previous experience learned from programmers would help the programming community to rise and may introduce new ideas to be developed in the future outside of the traditional programming languages box that is mainly based on syntax and semantic rules.

**Freedom and Focus in Coding**

Giving the freedom to programmers to describe their lines of code and having them written, also help new developers with the syntax understanding and memorizing making them more free to concentrate on logic and programming concepts.

### **Introduction to Super Resolution**
Image Super resolution is a widely studied problem in computer vision, where the objective is to convert a low- resolution image to a high- resolution image. Conventional methods for achieving super-resolution such as image priors, interpolation, sparse coding require a lot of pre/post processing and optimization. Recently, deep learning methods such as convolutional neural networks and generative adversarial networks are being used to perform super-resolution with results competitive to the state of the art but none of them have been used on microscopy images. In this thesis, a generative adversarial network, SRGAN, is proposed for super resolution with a perceptual loss function consisting of an adversarial loss, mean squared error and content loss. The objective of our implementation is to learn an end to end mapping between the low / high resolution images and optimize the upscaled image for quantitative metrics as well as perceptual quality. We then compare our results with the current state of the art methods in super resolution, conduct a proof of concept segmentation study to show that super resolved images can be used as an effective pre-processing step before segmentation and validate the findings statistically.

**Introduction: Cancer's Challenge**
Cancer is arguably one of the most dangerous and fatal diseases humanity has ever faced, this reputation came from a numerous number of reasons that researchers discovered throughout time. One of these main reasons is the difficulty of developing therapies. Not only the difficulty, but many people question the efficiency of these proposed therapies as many patients that undergo treatment and can be categorized as cancer-free individuals suffer from a newly developed cancer that is different from the originally treated cancer. Scientists discovered that this happens due to the heterogeneity of tumors and the inefficiency of treatments against rare cancer-cell populations that develop through time to form a new tumor with new characteristics due to lack of information about these populations.

**Method: Single-Cell RNA Sequencing**
With the help of single-cell RNA Sequencing (scRNA-Seq), we can now dissect tumors at a cellular level and tackle these rare cell populations and consider them in therapy research.

**Pipeline Proposal**
We propose a pipeline that works on scRNA-Seq data that embrace heterogeneity from human glioblastoma to provide more generic genetic features targeted for therapy considering these rare cell populations, by classifying the input sample into neoplastic and normal cell populations by a pretrained logistic regression model and detecting the heterogeneous clusters within the neoplastic population by a multinomial logistic regression classifier that we built from scratch that reaches an accuracy of 95%, after the data is labelled by the classifiers we extract the genetic features that are shared throughout the neoplastic cells for a more generalized efficient treatment with also being discriminative to those shared in normal cells to avoid damage of healthy cells.

**Results and Conclusion**
Our results lead to a better understanding for tumor heterogeneity by disclosing the untackled rare parts of tumors, resulting in genetic features that can be targeted in therapy research which consequently leads to better overall performance in cancer treatment and decrease in percentage of cancer recurrence.

## **Introduction**

Artificial intelligence (AI), a computer system aiming to mimic human
intelligence, is gaining increasing interest and is being incorporated into many
fields, including medicine. Stroke medicine is one such area of application of
AI, for improving the accuracy of diagnosis and the quality of patient care. For
stroke management, adequate analysis of stroke imaging is crucial. Recently, AI
techniques have been applied to decipher the data from stroke imaging and have
demonstrated some promising results.

## **Methods and Results**

Segmenting stroke lesions from T1-weighted MR images is of great value for
large-scale stroke rehabilitation neuroimaging analyses. Nevertheless, there are
great challenges with this task, such as large range of stroke lesion scales and
the tissue intensity similarity. The famous convolutional neural network, which
although has made great achievements in medical image segmentation areas,
may fail to address these challenges due to the insufficient uses of multi-scale
features and context information. So we demonstrate the feasibility and
performance of deep encoder-decoder neural networks for volumetric
segmentation of irreversibly damaged brain tissue lesions on T1-weighted MRI
scans for chronic stroke patients. A total of 239 T1-weighted MRI scans of
chronic ischemic stroke patients from a public dataset were retrospectively
analyzed by 3D deep convolutional segmentation models with residual learning,
using a novel zoom-in & out strategy. Dice similarity coefficient (DSC),
average symmetric surface distance (ASSD), and Hausdorff distance (HD) of
the identified lesions were measured by using manual tracing of lesions as the
reference standard. The proposed algorithm achieved good results with a dice
coefficient of 0.49.

**Introduction to Augmented Reality (AR)**
Augmented Reality (AR) is an interactive experience of a real-world environment where the objects that reside in the real world are enhanced by computer-generated perceptual information, sometimes across multiple sensory modalities, including visual, auditory, haptic, somatosensory and olfactory. AR can be defined as a system that incorporates three basic features: a combination of real and virtual worlds, real-time interaction, and accurate 3D registration of virtual and real objects. This project (AR-oom) utilizes the AR technology in the field of home furnishing by simulating the process of placing pieces of furniture in the room without getting the furniture piece itself and placing it in the room.

**AR-oom Features and Advantages**
AR-oom is not the first application that has developed this solution, but it has edges over other similar applications like: Ikea Place, Anthropologie and Houzz by being a cross platform application (working on both Android and IOS) and providing generic designs for furniture pieces which can be very useful for users who are trying out different designs for their room from scratch.

**Challenges Addressed by AR-oom**
AR-oom addresses many challenges such as: models appearing behind one another (occlusion), moving furniture pieces ignoring gravity, mis-estimation of the lighting in the room which lead to furniture pieces looking unrealistic, and many other challenges. In particular, it packs a lot of useful features to help deal with different aspects of this furnishing process such as: visualizing furniture pieces inside their actual environment, choosing a piece out of a big variety of different models of generic furniture pieces to help choose the most suitable, adding multiple pieces of furniture in the same scene (room). All these features are provided within our application to help achieve a satisfying design for the user. Moreover, the user can also take different screenshots of the final scene design.

**Enhancing User Satisfaction**
All these features are provided within our application to help increase user's satisfaction with the design, providing him/her with an easy and amazing experience of picking furniture."

"**Abstract**

Breast Cancer is one of the most abundant diseases among women worldwide, it represents 12% of all new cancer cases and 25% of all cancers in women, we have plenty of patient data and many recurrence cases so this project is used for both predicting if a person can have breast cancer again or not (recurrence) and analyzing data to detect which of our features is important and which of them is not significant using different ML (machine learning) techniques reaching best accuracy at (86.6%) in SVM (support vector machine). The cost of follow up and doing tests for patients is really high, knowing the risk percentage and working upon these basis and the patient historical condition we can prevent recurrence since when patient get cancer again it's more invasive and can destroy the body and even cause death in most cases, so early prediction helps to avoid this risk.

**Patients' Medical Records Phases**

Patients' medical records passed through the following phases:

*   **Preprocessing:** in which, patient's data are converted from being nominal to numeric to enable our classifiers algorithms to deal with them.

*   **Feature Selection:** patients' data include many features, our algorithm select the most important of them to classify depending on them.

*   **Classification:** these important features selected are the input for the chosen classifier to classify them based on recurrence label.

*   **Accuracy Calculation:** finally accuracy is calculated by cross validation and confusion matrix."

**Media Retrieval and Search**
Media files retrieval and searching is a complex process due to the variety in content and queries. All available video search engines enable searching for video by title, description, and metadata written by the publisher.

**Video Content and Indexing**
In general, video content is richer than a single image and platforms don't have all the info about the videos from just the publishers, in addition to that, most of the internet traffic is unlabeled videos that we need to understand its content to analyze it for personalized ads, security and many other use cases, so automatic indexing and retrieval are considered in multimedia research.

**CBVS Engine Limitation**
Achieving a general CBVS engine is impossible due to the limitation of building a model that can recognize and understand everything in the world.

**Project Approach**
In our project, we provide a modular system with interfaces to allow developers and scientists to integrate with it and feed the system with any models (statistical-based, machine learning, or any sub-program) so the system can use any number and combination of them in automatic distributive indexing environment, where end-user can just enter their query and get the results.

**Facial Recognition Models**
HOG-based facial recognition and COCO with YOLO 80 classes are built as two independent models to test and measure system modularity and architecture.

**Architecture Design**
The architecture is designed to enable high scalability by splitting the video processing phases into 6 main phases: segmentation, keyframes extraction, feature extraction, processing engine, indexing, and query/retrieval.

**Phase Deployment and Performance**
Each phase can be deployed independently on separate nodes to represent a layer of servers that receive input from the previous layer and send the output to the next layer. That design enabled us to run the whole process on the same dataset with a different number of processes to start with 29 mins to index using 1 process and end with 7 mins indexing time on 5 processes."

## **Introduction**
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a severe neurodevelopmental disease with a high
incidence and effective biomarkers are urgently needed for its diagnosis. A few previous
studies have reported the detection of miRNA (micro RNA) biomarkers for autism
diagnosis especially those based on bioinformatics approaches. The proposed model is
based on bioinformatics techniques for identifying autism miRNA biomarkers.

## **Methodology**
The proposed model downloads the Transcription factor genes dataset from several
experimentally validated databases, a dataset of autism related genes from DisGnet
database also an experimentally validated genes database and also a gene expression
microarray data from GEO database and extracted genes with expression levels that
differed in ASD
And the controls.

## **Results**
TF (Transcription factors) dataset are used to construct an autism-specific miRNA-
mRNA network and inferred candidate autism biomarker miRNAs based on their
regulatory effect on the targeted genes. Biological interaction network is constructed
based on biological functions and processes of the genes in the autism specific miRNA-
mRNA network in autism patients in which all those biological functions and processes
are altered in autism patients. The biological interactions network is also mapped to the
autism specific miRNA-mRNA network
The resulted MiRNA-Gene interaction network has 7 miRNAs and 121 genes,5 miRNAs
seems to have the highest effect on 15 genes.
Some interactions seem to be common between ASD and other neurodevelopment
disorders especially Alzheimer.

**Introduction**
The world has been facing a global pandemic for the past two years. So, with that in mind we have looked up how the students have been coping with the current state of online learning and recorded lessons and we have noticed a big difference in the number of students that open and listen to a whole recording and the number that are looking for a brief more convenient way to know the content of the lesson. So, we came up with an idea to make things easier for everyone to learn and know the contents which is to make an application which will listen to a speech then converts it to text and then summarize it.

**Study and Results**
To know if the summarization of a lesson or speech and converting it into brief text would be preferable, we conducted a survey to see whither the students would read a brief summery rather then listen to a long lesson. We found out that most of them preferred the summery to the whole recording.

**Conclusion**
These results pushed us to continue with our application development and yearn for the best result out of the summarization. So that we could make the whole learning process easier and help out the student get through these tough times better."

**Introduction to Autism Spectrum Disorder**
Autism spectrum disorder social facilitator can be considered as the opening door to an easier life on autistic children and their parents as well. Autism or as it's scientifically described ""autism spectrum disorder"" is a developmental disability caused by differences in the brain. People with autism spectrum disorder often have problems with social communication and interaction and are distracted by secondary objects. In our project, we managed to help differently by helping those with autism spectrum disorder to understand and focus on the things happening around just the same as how a normal person reacts and prioritize actions so that he can give the suitable reaction corresponding. So as the problem indicates, we mainly focus on the sight of the autistic person. Moving forward, how did our project help in such case? autism spectrum disorder social facilitator depends on videos collected from egocentric/Point of view cameras placed on a normal person, also eye signals dataset where both datasets combined and trained to teach a deep learning model to give higher priority to the direction the normal person will look at in a specific scene (outdoor / indoor). The highest accuracy we have reached is 98.26%. Our project is the first prototype of our idea.

**Workflow Overview**
Our Workflow consists of some steps starting with Video preprocessing where we made Frame extraction from the videos we have in our dataset, frame preprocessing which some steps applied on our extracted frames, then finally object detection.

**Signal Pre-processing**
Second step was Signal Pre-processing, we used some techniques such as Butter worth Band-pass Butterworth filter on eye signals (0.5-20), then Down Sampling and finally Feature extraction.

**Multilayer Perceptron Classifier**
Third step was combing eye signals output with frames output and then we headed to multilayer perceptron classifier to train the model, Since there are multiple layers of neurons, Multi-layer perceptron is a deep learning technique. Multi-layer perceptron is widely used for solving problems that require supervised learning as well as research into computational neuroscience and parallel distributed processing."

**Introduction: Impact of the Pandemic**

The Covid-19 pandemic caused kids nowadays to depend on e-learning and as a result spend a lot of time in front of their screens on daily basis. This means that children can be exposed to a new set of threats due to their use of web-based tools, downloading new applications, or reliance on email grows and there is no way for parents who are preoccupied with their daily tasks to monitor what their children are doing on the internet.

**Challenges in Internet Safety Awareness**

Added to that, most of the websites and resources available to raise awareness towards dealing with the dangers of internet are aimed at adults which means that they are far too advanced and not easy to understand by kids. As a result, it is nearly impossible for the younger generation to benefit from this information in any way. This makes them in danger while using the internet and easy target for internet predators.

**Problem Statement**
Daily Many products are published on E-commerce and sharing system. some of them good products and some of them does not have a good quality such as advertised although they have same name. Now how can know which one is good and which one is fake and who publisher is good who does not cheat, and his product is good and who is not good (whose products does not have good quality such as advertised). And it was too hard to read all reviews on each product which is good or not good.

**Introduction**
Chest X-Rays (CXRs) are widely used for diagnosing abnormalities in the chest area. Automatically detecting these abnormalities with high accuracy could greatly enhance real world diagnosis processes. Lack of standard publicly available dataset and benchmark studies, however, makes it difficult to compare and establish the best detection methods.

**Methodology**
In order to overcome these difficulties, we have used the publicly available NIH chest X-Ray Dataset and studied the performance of known deep convolutional network (DCN) architectures on different abnormalities. We employed heat maps obtained from occlusion sensitivity as a measure of localization in the CXRs. We find that the same DCN architecture doesn't perform well across all abnormalities. Shallow features or earlier layers consistently provide higher detection accuracy compared to deep features. We have also found ensemble models to improve classification significantly compared to single model.

**Results**
Combining this insight, we report the highest accuracy on chest X-Ray abnormality detection on this dataset. We applied the techniques developed along the way to the problem of tuberculosis detection on a different disease and achieved the highest accuracy on that task. Our localization experiments using these trained classifiers show that for spatially spread-out abnormalities like Effusion and Edema, the network can localize the abnormalities successfully most of the time.

**Conclusion**
We believe that through deep learning-based classification and localization, we will discover many more interesting features in medical image diagnosis that are not considered traditionally."

**Introduction to Mechanical Ventilators**

Mechanical ventilators are machines that act as bellows to move air in and out of your lungs. Your respiratory therapist and doctor set the ventilator to control how often it pushes air into your lungs and how much air you get. You may be fitted with a mask to get air from the ventilator into your lungs.

**Key Concepts**

*   **Ventilation:** Exchange of air between the lungs and the air (ambient or delivered by a ventilator), in other words, it is the process of moving air in and out of the lungs. Its most important effect is the removal of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the body, not on increasing blood oxygen content. Ventilation is measured as minute ventilation in the clinical setting, and it is calculated as respiratory rate (RR) times tidal volume (Vt). In a mechanically ventilated patient, the CO2 content of the blood can be modified by changing the tidal volume or the respiratory rate.
*   **Oxygenation:** Interventions that provide greater oxygen supply to the lungs, thus the circulation. In a mechanically ventilated patient, this can be achieved by increasing the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2%) or the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).
*   **PEEP:** The positive pressure that will remain in the airways at the end of the respiratory cycle (end of exhalation) is greater than the atmospheric pressure in mechanically ventilated patients. For a full description of the use of PEEP, please review the article titled ""Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP).""
*   **Tidal volume:** Volume of air moved in and outside the lungs in each respiratory cycle."

## **Introduction to Image Completion**
Image completion, which aims to fill unknown regions of an image is a fundamental task in computer vision. It can be broadly applied to the fields of image editing, such as old photo recovery, object removal, and seamless inpainting for the damaged image. For most such applications, it is a critical problem to generate semantically realistic completion results, specifically with a natural transition between known and unknown regions.

## **Semantic Inpainting System**
Our semantic inpainting system is built using generative adversarial networks (GAN), which is a recent powerful method in deep learning techniques. The model learns the representation of training data, and can, therefore, predict meaningful content for corrupted images, it can often obtain images with sharper edges which look much more realistic.

## **Advantages of the Project's Method**
One of the major advantages of our project's method is that it does not require the masks for training and can be applied for arbitrarily structured missing regions during inference.

## **Introduction**
A picture is worth a thousand words. Indeed, one of our most valuable senses is vision. With vision we interact with the surrounding environment, make decisions according to what we see, and maybe just enjoy the scenery. But some people don't have this sense such as blind people, or maybe it's weak for some people such as the visually impaired, or maybe some people can't make good use of what they see that they miss out on a bit of information in their surroundings that may even cause lives such as an inattentive driver. Image captioning is the task of giving full description to a certain image. This way, an image input will give a text or speech output, depending on the desired, which will give a full detailed description of the image, be it a still image or a video or even a surrounding live scene, and this will help the user fill their need. For example, this would help a blind person imagine the surrounding scene from the given caption as speech. 

## **Image Captioning**
Image captioning has been of great interest for the past few years, the advances in the field of natural language processing and computer vision helped in its evolution. The approaches for solving the problem of generating captions for a given image are mainly divided into two phases, the first phase is concerned with detecting and recognizing objects in the image, the second phase is generating a paragraph consists of set of sentences to describe the image. The models used in this work are convolution neural network for object detection and features extraction and recurrent neural network for sentences generation. The model is trained on MSCOCO dataset which contains a variety of objects and scenes and is large enough to train the deep neural network model.

**Introduction: The Rise of Recommender Systems**

During the last few decades, with the rise of YouTube, Netflix and many other platforms, recommender systems have taken more and more place in our live. From e-commerce (suggest to buyers articles that could interest them) to online advertisement (suggest to user the right contents, matching their performance), recommender systems are today unavoidable in our daily online journeys. recommender systems minimize the transaction costs and improves the quality and decision-making process to users.

**Recommender Systems: Algorithms and Information Gathering**

In very large way, recommender system are algorithms aimed to suggest relevant items to users (items being movies to watch, text to read, products to buy or anything else depend om industries). It gathers huge amount of information about user's preferences of several items like online shopping products, movies, TV, tourism, restaurants, etc. It stores information of different ways either positive or negative manner. It captures users review for watched movies, traveled places, and purchased products.

**Importance of Recommender Systems**

Recommender systems are really critical in some industries as they can generate a hug amount of income when they are efficient or also be a way to stand out significantly from competitors."

## **Introduction**
Now days if you have a valuable information can you trust ordinary storage methods with 100%!! it is not always working. SO People are always looking for secure methods to protect valuable information against unauthorized access or use. That's why disciplines like cryptography and steganography are gaining a great interest among researchers nowdays ,recent Information Hiding techniques embed data into various digital media such as sound, images, and videos. However, in this project we took a step further to utilize DNA sequences as a carrier of secret information. So we have discussed 3 methods to hide information into DNA to protect and store secret information.

## **Algorithm 1: Isbase**
First algorithm discussed is Isbase The algorithm utilizes the idea of codon degeneracy and silent mutations in order to embed the secret information into the genetic sequence without changing its functionality, Furthermore, the extraction process can be done blindly without any need to the reference sequence.

## **Algorithm 2: Blind Data Hiding**
Second algorithms which is Blind Data Hiding Using Playfair Ciphering where we get the secret data transforming it into an incomprehensive format (cipher text) which can then be deciphered using some kind of a secret key

## **Algorithm 3: DNA Watermarking**
and the third method which is watermarking DNA Watermarking Using Codon Postfix Technique: aims to protect the copyright of DNA sequences by embedding binary bits into real DNA sequences. Which mutates the codon postfix according to the embedded bit the proposed DNA watermarking method proved to be secured, undetectable, resistance, and preservative to biological functions.

## **Features of the Project**
And some of features of the project is encryption , decryption , Shuffling and Ciphering .

**Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Photo-Realistic Images**
With the rapid growth of generative adversarial networks (GANs), a photo-realistic image can be easily generated from a low-dimensional random vector nowadays. However, the generated image can be used to synthesize several persons who may have a potential effect on society with radical contents. Considering that many techniques that produce a photorealistic facial image based on different GANs are already available, collecting training images of all possible generative models is difficult. Hence, the learning-based approach would not effectively detect a fake image generated using an excluded generative model [1].

**Proposed Approach for Fake Image Detection**
To overcome this shortcoming, In this project we develop an application that takes an image and determines whether the image is fake or real, It implements a two-step pairwise learning approach to learn common fake features over the training images generated by using different generative models. First, the triplet loss will be used to simulate the relation between fake and real images and utilize to learn the discriminative features. Then, we develop a coupled network to accurately capture local and global image features of the fake or real images.

**Experimental Results**
The experimental results demonstrate that the method outperforms the baseline supervised learning methods for fake facial image detection.

## **Introduction to Business Analysis**
In software projects, a huge number of unstructured text documents from various stakeholders come available and need to be analysed and transformed into structured requirements. Business Analysis is a research discipline of identifying business needs and determining solutions to business problems which makes it a very critical part in developing software, and is known to be time consuming and error prone when performed manually. It reveals the tremendous value that the work of a Business Analyst (BA) brings for the businesses. Business Analyst Intelligent Assistant tool is created to ease the process of collecting the requirements in the pre-requirements elicitation phase which includes, re-listening to meeting records, heavy documentation, and conflict detection, by making this tedious process semi-automated to improve the time consumption problem and to be editable so that it satisfies the BAs intellect.

## **Introduction**
In recent years, mining of valuable information from online sources has become a prominent research area. Nowadays, social media has become part of our daily life and used by millions of people around the world.

## **Problem Statement**
Although there is social media today, news media still tells us what is happening in the world in its traditional ways. With the presence of social media, a huge amount of data is produced daily, which may be related to news content. For these assets to be useful. We must find approach to filter clamor and noise and only capture the material that is valuable and important based on its similarity to the news media.

## **Proposed Solution**
Although the clamor and noise were removed, there is still an additional burden on the information at the present time in the rest of the information. Therefore, this information must be organized for use and to achieve priority. To achieve this priority, we consider three important factors.

*   Firstly, the Media Focus (MF) of the topic which is the temporal prevalence of a particular topic in the news media is a factor of importance.
*   Secondly, User Attention (UA) which is the temporal prevalence of the topic in social media.
*   Last, User Interaction (UI) toward the topic which is the interaction between the social media users who mention this topic.

## **Application and Results**
So, we propose an application to filter uninformative information and capture only useful information related to news media and prioritize and rank news information using social media factors Media Focus (MF), User Attention (UA) and User Interaction (UI).

Our trials demonstrate that the improvement of quality and variety of automatically identified news topics.

## **Introduction to Autism Spectrum Disorder**
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a group of heterogeneous developmental disabilities that manifest in early childhood. Its most prominent characteristics are difficulties with social interaction and communication, and restricted and repetitive behavior. Most diagnoses based on R-fMRIs do not consume time to detect early ASD in children which can help understand the brain alterations that cause ASD with accuracies up to 80% according to recent studies.

## **Project Purpose and Data Source**
The purpose of this project is to use deep learning algorithms to identify individuals with ASD purely based on their brain activity patterns. To achieve this goal, we relied on ASD patients brain imaging data from a world-wide multi-site database known as ABIDE (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange).

## **Project Description: Website and Algorithms**
The project consists of a website that provides two different deep learning algorithms that will help identify autism from R-fMRI scans as well as 2D scans. The first approach consists of a deep neural network (DNN) model to classify autism spectrum disorder patients using R-fMRI scans from said patients. The second approach consists of a convolutional neural network (CNN) that will be needed to classify autism spectrum disorder patients using 2D images of MRI scans of their brain.

## **Results and Conclusion**
The project has achieved 75% accuracy in the first approach which is a considerable improvement to the studies made on classifying the whole ABIDE dataset. The second approach resulted in 80% accuracy which is considered an achievement due to the high similarity of the images of the MRI scans. The present study has demonstrated that the use of deep neural networks in the diagnosis of ASD has outperformed other machine learning techniques.

**Introduction to the Pandemic**
The ongoing COVID-19 corona virus outbreak has caused a global disaster with its deadly spreading. Due to the absence of effective remedial agents and the shortage of immunizations against the virus, population vulnerability increases.

**The Role of Social Distancing**
In the current situation, as there are no vaccines available; therefore, social distancing is thought to be an adequate precaution (norm) against the spread of the pandemic virus. The risks of virus spread can be minimized by avoiding physical contact among people.

**Objective and Methodology**
The purpose of this work is, therefore, to provide a deep learning platform for social distance tracking using an overhead perspective. The framework uses the YOLOv3 object recognition paradigm to identify humans in video sequences. The transfer learning methodology is also implemented to increase the accuracy of the model. In this way, the detection algorithm uses a pre-trained algorithm that is connected to an extra trained layer using an overhead human data set. The detection model identifies peoples using detected bounding box information. Using the Euclidean distance, the detected bounding box centroid's pairwise distances of people are determined. To"

**Project Overview**
This project was developed for the new influencers who want to upload videos on their page or channel. Hopefully, it helps them to raise their reach and their subscribers. The application is mainly about three modules.

**Module 1: NLP Module**
The first module is the NLP module; it's a module which trains the application to predict a more accurate score for the user input video without making processes on every video any user inserts and that increases the efficiency and the response speed of the application.

**Module 2: Object Detection Module**
The second module is the Object Detection module; it detects any object in the video to help the NLP module to predict accurate score for the video while training the application. Also, it helps the recommendation system module, which is the third module, while recommending objects to compare between the existing objects in the video and the missing objects that can be added to increase the score and the number of viewers.

**Module 3: Recommendation System Module**
The third module is the Recommendation System module; it's the second and last phase the user input video goes through. It's the phase where the user chooses the video category and enters the title of the video. This module uses an algorithm named Key-Nearest-Neighbor, which compares the score of the video to the nearest K neighbors. In the end, the module recommends set of objects will, hopefully, raise the score of the video and attracts a lot of viewers.

## **Project Focus**
In this project, we focus on generating a video sequence so that an object in a
source image is animated according to the motion of a driving video sequence.

## **Current Methodologies**
Current methods rely heavily on supervised approaches where they use
pre-trained models in order to extract object-specific representations such as
keypoint locations. Unfortunately, these pre-trained models are built using costly
ground-truth data annotations. In this project, We follow the first-order motion
model to represent motion. Authors address this problem without using any
annotation or prior information about the specific object to animate. Once the
model is trained on a set of videos including objects of the same category
(e.g.faces, human bodies), this method can be applied to any object of this class.

## **Approach**
To achieve this, Appearance and motion information is represented using a
self-supervised formulation. And to support complex motions, they represent
motion in the source image and driving frame with a set of keypoint
displacement along with their local affine transformations. In addition, A
generator network models occlusions arising during target motions and combines
the appearance extracted from the source image and the motion derived from the
driving video. They also propose to model occlusions in order to indicate to the
generator network which image parts should be painted. We trained our model on
two datasets, vox-celeb for human faces, and Tai-Chi HD datasets for human
bodies."

**Challenges and Needs**
Given the rapid changes on the online information and increase of their volume and complexity over time and the ways that people look for their needs are becoming old and time consuming. Therefore people need modern ways to search for their needs in a reasonable and saving time way. Recommender systems are used to recommend useful items to a user. Context information can be used to characterize the state of an item like Climate, Location, and Age, etc... for more accurate recommendations.

**Project Overview**
In our project, we developed a reusable component which recommends items to users based on his/her pervious ratings to a similar item and also based on a set of contexts. The systems use association rules to be able to deal with and understand any type of contexts. This feature makes the system in addition to being reusable, it makes it also customizable to any application."

**Introduction**
Smart E-Learning or intelligent education includes new educational contexts in which the importance is focused on the student's use of technology at their fingertips. Our aim in this project is to develop a smart E-learning Environment using virtual reality Technology to help the students to practice the lab experiments via computer interface in what we can called ""Virtual Lab"". The system developed using 2D environment using traditional cameras, which lessen the cost of the system.

**Hand Detection and Classification**
The First part of the project is developing hand detection, tracking and classification Module in which we present an enhanced methodology for hand detection and hand gesture classification for classifying the two hand gestures ""open hand"" and ""Close hand"" that we used to control catching the items in our 2D Smart ELearning environment.

**Implementation Details**
We Build a real time hand detector using Single shot detector (SSD) algorithm using tensorflow. The trained model using 10 epochs resulted ~98% accuracy, which is very high compared to other models.
**Kalman filter** is used in our proposed method to predict the X and the Y positions of the hand for hand tracking. Our team has created a new classification model to classify the two hand gestures and trained the model by very large number of images for opened and closed hand dataset in different positions for high accuracy. By trying already prepared dataset we didn't get the needed accuracy so, we created our own new dataset. By working on Google Colab and by using Tensorflow and Keras we built a new deep convolutional neural network VGG-16 Model for classification of hand gestures using the pre-trained weights image Net. Classification model gives a high accuracy that reached 95%.

**Impact of Current Circumstances**

At this extreme moment, we began working from home, away from campus, and keeping social distance from as many people as possible. As we stay home and stick with the foods that have been in our fridge, we are temporarily living a sedentary lifestyle with increased odds of physical inactivity, excessive eating and sitting, stress, anxiety, and depression. Many of us will gain some weight during the pandemic and may keep the extra weight permanently, which may carry considerable health risks for type 2 diabetes, hypertension, heart attack, stroke, and other health problems. This is where the importance of Careium Artificial Intelligence (AI) Food Tracker comes in.

**Careium AI Food Tracker Overview**

Accordingly, the Careium Al Food Tracker (Android) application helps diabetes, liver patients, and those who want to track their health throughout the day through daily meals by calculating the calories and minerals per each meal by taking a picture of the meal, and the application detects the food type and analyzes its calories and minerals. Also, the application follows up gaining or losing weight, or even avoiding some food due to allergies. That is achieved using Deep Learning and Image Processing.

**Functionality and Results**

Careium AI Food Tracker shows astonishing results compared to what was expected for a simple use case example. Capturing the food plate, long dish, deep dish or even scattered amount of food, Careium can still segment the food region, process it and predicts the main five nutrition components (Calories, Mass, Fat, Carbs, Proteins). Calories are measured in cal, all others are measured in grams. It can be used in classifying a mixed dish of food into multiple food categories, generating food eaten reports periodically, recommending a proper meal from a set of different available meals in a given dataset and giving alarms for each mealtime."

CRC is the third leading cause of cancer related death in the United States,2019.

**Genetic Predisposition**
A recent study indicates that approximately 25% of CRC cases have a genetic predisposition.

**Definition of Colorectal Cancer (CRC)**
Colorectal cancer (CRC) also known as bowel cancer, colon cancer, or rectal cancer, is the development of cancer from the colon. the global incidence of this cancer has increased rapidly with population growth.

**Cancer Type and Location**
It's a type of cancer that begins in the large intestine (colon). The colon is the final part of the digestive tract.

**Typical Affected Age**
Colon cancer typically affects older adults, though it can happen at any age. It usually begins as small, noncancerous (benign) clumps of cells called polyps that form on the inside of the colon. Over time some of these polyps can become colon cancers.

**Colon Cancer Incidence Stats in 2020**

*   In 2020, there will be an estimated 104,610 new cases of colon cancer diagnosed

*   In the US. Although the majority of CRCs are in adults ages 50 and older, 17,930 (12%) will be diagnosed in individuals younger than age 50, The equivalent of 49 new cases per day."

## **Text-to-Image Synthesis**
Text-to-Image Synthesis aims to generate realistic-looking images from human-written descriptive texts. This would reduce time and effort for drawing each pixel of an image whether by yourself or using a designing application. Text-to-Image Synthesis would be interesting and very useful for many types of people.

## **Expressing Imagination**
Sometimes, people need to express their imagination in a visualized form or presenting information in the form of a picture (some of its beneficial applications will be discussed in detail later - Section 1.1. -). Recently, it is applicable to use the power of neural networks architecture to generate images from descriptive texts.

## **Model Development**
First of all, we developed a model which utilizes the GANs by training a generator and a discriminator. Our model will not only generate images which look real and describing what has been written, but also, to make attention to every single word in the input sentence (Global Attention). By attention mechanism, our model is able to produce an image having the most similarity with the text by comparing the encoded input sentence (context vector) and the image features. In our project, we generate plausible images of birds and flowers by using CUB and Oxford datasets respectively, which are typically describing the input text, then we contribute more to make them of higher resolution and quality by adding more attention layer (Channel-wise Attention).

## **AttnGAN Model**
Recently, the AttnGAN model designed a word-level global attention to guide the generator to focus on subregions corresponding to the most relevant word."

**Introduction**
There are hundreds of kinds of trees in the natural ecosystem, and it can be very difficult to distinguish between them. Botanists and those who study plants, however, are able to identify the type of tree briefly by using the characteristics of the leaf. Machine learning is used to automatically classify leaf types. Studied extensively in 2012, this is a rapidly growing field based on deep learning. Deep learning is itself a self-learning technique used on large amounts of data, and recent developments in hardware and big data have made this technique more practical.

**Methodology**
We trained CNN model on plants from different datasets using TensorFlow backend. While training the model we compared between three CNN models ResNet50, VGG16 architectures and a custom CNN we built. The trained model is converted to TensorFlow Lite model and merged with our android mobile application to be used by users. The application achieves good identification accuracy and provides Android users a useful system for plant identification."

A human brain is center of the nervous system; it is a collection of white mass of cells. A tumor of brain is collection of uncontrolled increasing of these cells abnormally found in different part of the brain namely Glial cells, neurons, lymphatic tissues, blood vessels, pituitary glands and other part of brain which lead to the cancer.

## **Detection and Identification**
Manually it is not so easily possible to detect and identify the tumor. Programming division method by MRI is way to detect and identify the tumor. In order to give precise output a strong segmentation method is needed. Brain tumor identification is really challenging task in early stages of life. But now it became advanced with various machine learning and deep learning algorithms. Now a day's issue of brain tumor automatic identification is of great interest. In Order to detect the brain tumor of a patient we consider the data of patients like MRI images of a patient's brain.

## **Importance of Detection**
It is very important to detect the tumors at starting level for a healthy life of a patient. There are many literatures on detecting these kinds of brain tumors and improving the detection accuracies. The segmentation, detection, and extraction of infected tumor area from magnetic resonance (MR) images are a primary concern but a tedious and time taking task performed by radiologists or clinical experts, and their accuracy depends on their experience only. So, the use of computer aided technology becomes very necessary to overcome these limitations. We estimate the brain tumor severity using Convolutional Neural Network algorithm which gives us accurate results."

**Introduction**
Social media has become increasingly popular over the last decade, and people of all ages and ethnicities use it daily. It is used to express their thoughts, feelings, and emotions about places, events, news, etc.

**Data Extraction**
The Data which we can extract from location-based social networks provide a wealth of information on urban dwellers' where-about. Furthermore, this data show who is spending time where, when, and what sort of activity (e.g. shopping in a mall or eating in a restaurant). Such knowledge can, in effect, be used to identify the city regions in terms of the activities that take place therein.

**Example**
As example, data may show that people visit one region mainly for shopping in the morning, while the other for dinner in the evening. Therefore, if such a summary is available, more specific questions can be asked. For example, one might ask what features differentiate one region from another {some regions may be different in terms of the type of places and venues they host and others in terms of the tourists and visitors they attract.

**Methodology**
In this paper, we present a method for answering such questions using publicly shared Foursquare data and twitter check-ins data. Our analysis uses the Classification Models, which include the exact location of the activity, the users who participate in the activity, as well as the time of day and day of the week and the season of the year in which the activity takes place.

**Tool Provided**
We provide a tool that could be used by any tourist or investor. It provides the tourist with the best venue to visit or best activity to do or to check-in his location and it provides investor with the analyzes that he needs and recommend best spot for him to establish his business, best place to market his business and best category of business to open in a specific region.

**Introduction**
Although the breakthroughs in accuracy and speed of single image
super-resolution using faster and deeper convolutional neural
networks, one central problem remains largely unsolved, how do we
recover the finer details when we super-resolve at large upscaling
factors? The behaviour of optimization-based super-resolution
methods is principally driven by the choice of the objective function.
Recent work has largely focused on minimizing the mean squared
reconstruction error. The resulting estimates have high peak
signal-to-noise ratios, but they are often lacking high-frequency
details and are perceptually unsatisfying in the sense that they fail
to match the fidelity expected at the higher resolution.

**Proposed Approach**
To achieve this, we propose a perceptual loss function which
consists of an adversarial loss and a content loss, The adversarial
loss pushes our solution to the natural image manifold, In addition,
we use a content loss motivated by perceptual similarity instead of
similarity in pixel space and we use deep residual network is able
to recover photo-realistic textures from heavily downsampled
images on public benchmarks. An extensive mean-opinion-score
(MOS) test shows hugely significant gains in perceptual quality
using SRGAN."

**Introduction**
The graph representation shows incredible potential in solving the protein localization problem, because it uses both feature-based information and sample proximity information, whereas the entire scientific community was solely focused on raw image representations to solve the protein localization problem on a cellular level.

**Methodology**
By building a graph data structure based on similarity relationships, we explored the graphical representation in this project. The ORB descriptors, which offer faster means of comparison, were the focus of image comparison.

**Results**
Simple solutions had to be tested first, because the project is experimenting with a new domain of information representation. A slack evaluation model failed to deliver insightful findings. Moving on to GCNs was therefore necessary to provide a better solution. This shows that the graph representations are effective for solving this issue and can be extended to address other biological issues.

**Conclusion**
By adding a suitable pragmatic representation of node features, the quality of the predictions made by the GCN model would be improved. A significantly better model that can outperform any prior research on the issue would be produced by training the model on both the entire graph and node features.

## **Introduction**
Circumstances, ranging from work accidents and sports injuries to genetics and lifestyle choices can be the cause of Spinal problems. Proper diagnosis and abnormality detection are very important for further treatment. But many patients have made this task very difficult and time-consuming so, computer- based automatic detection of abnormality can become very handy as well as timesaving. About one billion people worldwide suffer from spinal pain. It is also one of the biggest single causes of disability and thus affects our quality of life immensely. Radiologists still use hard workloads to detect lesions by manually examining spinal medical pictures in everyday radiological practice. As Spine MRI is very complicated and have a lot of details that not everyone can detect by bare eyes, So, we decided to take advantage of Deep Learning techniques and help the radiologists, because working in the medical field makes people's lives and health a priority.

## **System Overview**
Our System focuses on both Spine classification and Lesions detection in spine, Our models are trained on dataset from El-Demerdash and Ain Shams university hospitals. First Classifier which classify Spine Parts (Cervical, Dorsal, and Lumbar). Second, it could classify multiple Lesions (Classify 9 different diseases in the spine) found in single MRI image, The overall accuracy of Multi-Label Classification is about 70%.
Second, it detects lesions found in each vertebra and draw a bounding box on it to visualize it to the patient/radiologist.

## **Conclusion**
If we want to create enough opportunities to treat a maximum number of patients, then we must accelerate the diagnosis process itself. CNN is an excellent deep learning method for image classification and other computer vision tasks and with the availability of medical datasets, several methods have been proposed to classify radiographs.

**Customer Behavior in Supermarkets**
Despite the presence of E-commerce people tend to buy many products only in supermarkets and malls for the sake of their own satisfaction. Among the difficulties faced by the customers one difficulty is to follow queue through the billing process. Though their intent is just to buy one or two products, waiting to bill products consumes time and also inconvenient these days as people live in a busy environment. As per our survey money and average time spent on each customer is high especially in overcrowded supermarkets.

**Smart Machines and Billing Process**
The shopkeepers are ready to welcome any smart machines that automate the billing process to reduce manpower and time consumed for that process. The main aim is to satisfy the customer and also reduce the time spent on the billing process which is to complete the billing process in the trolley rather than waiting in a queue even for one or two products. The customers have to add the products after a short scan in trolley and when done the finalized amount will be displayed in the trolley.

**Payment and Security**
Customer could either pay their bill by their ATM cards or through pre-recharged customer card provided by the shop. We have ensured security for preventing theft and also facilitated for users who unknowingly drop their projects into trolley by cautioning them.

**Ultimate Goal**
Our ultimate motto is to mitigate the time consumption in purchase by getting rid of queue ensuring customer's comfort and shrinking the tediousness of barcode scanning and eliminating waging of billers, thereby accomplishing both customer and shopkeeper demands."

**Challenges in Biological Network Analysis**
As much real-life insights as complex biological networks can reveal, yet its analysis and study is considered to be a challenging task. In conjunction with the high-throughput available biological data including genomics, transcriptome, and proteomics, the foundation for system-level analyses was laid, system-level study is based on grouping the elements of a system based on a specific threshold of similarity between them, and thus a network is formed.

**Interpretation of Network Relations**
From such a network intriguing relations can be interpreted. In this context, our study aims to shed the light on the relevance between different cancer diseases, promoting a comprehensive understanding of the potential linkage between them aiding in further more promising potency of tumor prognosis and therapy. In order to apply such an approach in practice, our project featured the implementation of a framework based on protein-protein interaction dataset integrating the idea of K-Nearest-Neighbor algorithm along with Dijkstra algorithm to identify the impact of a protein on other proteins, constructing a protein-disease network on which graph theory concepts, and network properties analyses are applied to infer relevance between different cancer diseases. Our project featured as well as visualization for the queried output. Our project key uniqueness relies on the built-in specified ordinal pipeline for manipulating the underlying network, making it easier for the user experience rather than having to go through the hassle of manually pre specifying the pipeline to be used, which in return requires a higher degree of expertise.

**Project Outcomes**
Our project overcame the shortness of available experimental reference data through the usage of literature-based methods. Through the analyses of our predicted candidate protein-disease network clusters, some promising associations between different types of cancer disease were revealed with increasing accuracy upon applying on more records from our underlying dataset.

**Limitations and Future Directions**
Unfortunately we could not extend the calculations to cover all our available underlying data due to lack of computational available resources, thereby our project is scalable, and our predicted hypothesis is held true upon applying on a larger scale. Further supporting evidence can be obtained by experimental approaches in order to avoid artifacts and any potential bias. In addition, our methodology can be upgraded to generalize to other association studies in furtherance of knowledge and inferences in biomedical science.

**Authorship Identification**

Authorship identification is a task of identifying authors of anonymous texts given examples of the writing of authors. The increasingly large volumes of anonymous texts on the Internet enhance the great yet urgent necessity for authorship identification. Text mining is one of the main and typical tasks of machine learning (ML). Authorship identification (Al) is a standard research subject in text mining and natural language processing (NLP) that has undergone a remarkable evolution these last years. We need to identify the actual author of anonymous texts given on the basis of a set of writing samples. Standard text classification often focuses on many handcrafted features such as dictionaries, knowledge bases, and different stylometric characteristics, which often leads to remarkable dimensionality. Unlike traditional approaches, Textual features are the important elements for Authorship Identification .It is therefore important to analyze them and identify the most promising features.

Deception is common in our daily lives. Some lies might have severe consequences, especially the ones in crucial areas such as police investigations, airport security, and courtroom trials. The ability of humans to detect deception without any special aids is limited to around 54% [1].

**Challenges in Detecting Deception**
When people are deceptive they do involuntary facial micro-expressions [2] that appear in less than a second and are hard to be detected except by professionals which is a difficult process for humans, it can take years to be able to tell if someone is deceiving you and it will be costly to train someone to be able to detect deception, and probably won't always be able to tell accurately.

**Goal and Methodology**
Our goal was to make a machine learning model that can detect these micro-expressions and detect any kind of deceptions being made which will also be cheaper than hiring a professional and helpful in many fields like police investigations

**Research and Results**
In our research we explored some of the benchmarks to try and enhance them. We worked from scratch to build similar models and test ourselves to see the effect of a person's visual features and their microexpressions combined. Our system achieved an accuracy of 80%."

## **Introduction**
Health is a crown to the heads of healthy people, and it is one of the most important blessings that God has given us, so we must preserve it well so that we can complete our missions and messages in the life for which we were created. But unfortunately, the drug counterfeit problem has become global and so huge that it has drawn significant attention from everyone.

## **Problem Statement**
The fake drug industry is worth $10B per year as estimated by survey. Also estimated by WHO, about a million die per year due to fake drugs. The distribution of fake drugs is a crucial issue. One of main reasons behind drug counterfeiting is imperfect supply chain. There are many loopholes in our drug supply chain. In the present scenario of supply chain, either the information is not at all shared between the parties during the hand-off process or a little or irrelevant information is shared, which has led to counterfeiting. The counterfeit drug not only affects the health condition of patients but also results in the financial loss of genuine manufacturer.

**Introduction**
Identification of the correct biomarkers with respect to health issues and detection of the same is of paramount importance for the development of clinical decision support systems. For the patients suffering from Parkinson's Disease (PD), it has been duly observed that impairment in the handwriting is directly proportional to the severity of the disease.

**Methods**
Also, the speed and pressure applied to the pen while sketching or writing something are also much lower in patients suffering from Parkinson's disease. Therefore, correctly identifying such biomarkers accurately and precisely at the onset of the disease will lead to a better clinical diagnosis. Therefore, in this paper, a system design is proposed for analyzing Spiral drawing patterns and wave drawing patterns in patients suffering from Parkinson's disease and healthy subjects.

**Results**
The system developed in the study leverages two different convolutional neural networks (CNN), for analyzing the drawing patters of both spiral and wave sketches respectively. Further, the prediction probabilities are trained on a Stacked classifier to provide a weighted prediction from both the spiral and wave sketch. The complete model was trained on the data of 55 patients and has achieved an overall accuracy of 97%."

## **Project Importance and Approach**
The importance of the project lies in helping the students to understand the programming concepts in an interactive way with some entertainment to help them clearly know the basics of any concept which is not easy to understand through the traditional ways. Simulating the concept as a game story makes it easy to understand the complex concepts faster than learning them through the traditional ways. So, we put the learner in the right place to start learning and go deep in this field. After playing each level, we test his understanding of this concept by giving him a quiz about the level he already played. Starting from this point, we can simulate any field not only the programming fields, such as simulating dangerous fields like medical or pharmaceutical field. This will help the students to safely test any experiments or surgeries.

## **Learning Process and Objectives**
At this way, the learning process has become easier specially for the practical fields. Of Course, it does not cover everything about a chosen field, but it gives a clear simple overview about it and answers the basic questions of everything we learn: **Why we need this?** The answer is we need to learn this to solve a specific problem. As an example, the problem of recognizing the objects and differentiating between them by the software. How this could be done without image classifier. And **how we do this?** This question is answered along the whole game story, it will make the player do the solution steps on his own as simple as possible.

## **Implementation and Features**
So, according to the implementation of our short vision, which is (level 1), we can say that the main features that are represented in the project are: Helping the player to understand the main pipeline/steps of solving the ML problems, putting these steps (data preprocessing, model training and testing) into an actual game story with continuous instructions for the player to know what to do at a specific time, giving a quiz to the learner at the end of the level to test his understanding, and providing the player with the external resources to help him going deep into this field and continue learning the theoretical part.

## **Introduction: Importance of Fire Detection**
Fire detection and management is very important to prevent social, ecological, and economic damages as well as saving people's lives, properties, national forests, and wild areas.

## **Limitations of Sensor-Based Systems**
Sensor-based fire detection systems are expensive, complex and even place-controlled so, they are not efficient enough for real time fire detection. In order to overcome the limitations of the sensor-based systems, our research is investigating a video-based fire detector that can detect a fire in its early stage as soon as the smoke enters its field of vision, and thus does not require the smoke to migrate to the sensor. So, it gives more considerable surveillance coverage and offers the advantage of fast response (high speed) and wide detection areas.

## **YOLOv5-Based Fire and Smoke Detection**
This work presents a real-time video-based fire and smoke detection using YOLOv5 based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in anti-fire surveillance systems. It can achieve 24/7 automatic monitoring through using CTTV cameras and thus, minimizing the overall costs as there's no need to purchase any extra equipment. So, our system can be used in any place or building that has a CCTV system or camera such as like town centers, roads, airports, courts, universities, hospitals, schools, stores, and on public transport.

## **Model Training and Evaluation**
Our Yolov5 model has been trained with a large scale of augmented fire/smoke and negative videos in different environments, both with indoor and outdoor fire and smoke image sets. The trained model was tested and compared to the other state-of-the-art methods. Thus, our architecture can process real nature images of different resolutions and different scenarios and yet be able to detect the fire on them.

## **System Deployment and User Interaction**
We have deployed our model in a server that scan all the cameras connected to it. When the server detects fire through any of these scanned cameras, it sends an image of the detected fire to the users in charge who are connected to it through an API. The users in return should decide whether the image contains a fire or not and according to this they whether take the necessary actions to extinguish the fire or send back the false positive classified image to the server to retrain the model on such an image.

## **User Interface**
Finally, we offered the user the luxury of a user-friendly interface."

**Introduction: The Growing Need for Enhanced Security**

Nowadays, there has been a rise in the amount of disruptive and offensive activities that have been happening. Due to this, security has been given principal significance. Public places like shopping centres, avenues, banks, etc are increasingly being equipped with CCTVs to guarantee the security of individuals. Subsequently, this inconvenience is making a need to computerize this system with high accuracy.

**Challenges of Human Surveillance**

Since constant observation of these surveillance cameras by humans is a near-impossible task. It requires workforces and their constant attention to judge if the captured activities are anomalous or suspicious. Hence, this drawback is creating a need to automate this process with high accuracy. Moreover, there is a need to display which frame and which parts of the recording contain the uncommon activity which helps the quicker judgment of that unordinary action being unusual or suspicious.

**Deep Learning for Threat Recognition**

Therefore, to reduce the wastage of time and labor, we are utilizing deep learning algorithms for Automating Threat Recognition System. Its goal is to automatically identify signs of aggression and violence in real-time, which filters out irregularities from normal patterns. We intend to utilize different Deep Learning models (CNN) to identify and classify levels of high movement in the frame. From there, we can raise a detection alert for the situation of a threat, indicating the suspicious activities at an instance of time.

**Experimental Results**

When we used CNN and other models with our Dataset, We achieve 86% accuracy in detecting suspicious activities."

Sports analytics has been successfully applied in sports like football and basketball. However, its application in soccer has been limited. Research in soccer analytics with Machine Learning techniques is limited and is mostly employed only for predictions. There is a need to find out if the application of Machine Learning can bring better and more insightful results in soccer analytics. In this thesis, we perform descriptive as well as predictive analysis of soccer matches and player performances.

## **Football Rating Analysis**
In football, it is popular to rely on ratings by experts to assess a player's performance. However, the experts do not unravel the criteria they use for their rating. We attempt to identify the most important attributes of player's performance which determine the expert ratings. In this way we find the latent knowledge which the experts use to assign ratings to players. We performed a series of classifications with three different pruning strategies and an array of Machine Learning algorithms. The best results for predicting ratings using performance metrics had mean absolute error of 0.17. We obtained a list of most important performance metrics for each of the playing positions which approximates the attributes considered by the experts for assigning ratings. Then we find the most influential performance metrics of the players for determining the match outcome and we examine the extent to which the outcome is characterized by the performance attributes of the players. We found 34 performance attributes"

## **Diabetic Retinopathy Overview**
Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the fastest growing cause of blindness, with nearly 415 million diabetic patients at risk worldwide. If caught early, the disease can be treated; if not, it can lead to irreversible blindness. Unfortunately, medical specialists capable of detecting the disease are not available in many parts of the world where diabetes is prevalent.

## **Traditional Detection Methods**
One of the most common ways to detect diabetic eye disease is to have a specialist examine pictures of the back of the eye and rate them for disease presence and severity. Severity is determined by the type of lesions present (e.g. microaneurysms, hemorrhages, hard exudates, etc.), which are indicative of bleeding and fluid leakage in the eye. Interpreting these photographs requires specialized training, and in many regions of the world there aren't enough qualified graders to screen everyone who is at risk.

## **Deep Learning Application**
Deep Learning methods, such as the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), have recently become one of the new trends in the Computer Vision area. Their ability to find strong spatially local correlations in the data at different abstraction levels allows them to learn a set of filters that are useful to correctly segment the data, when given a labeled training set.

## **Project Implementation**
In this project different Convolutional neural network model are applied a diabetic retinopathy classification system using a deep learning with convolutional neural network that can identify features as micro-aneurysms, exudate and hemorrhages on the retina which system should classify the image according to according to the DR presence and severity and return the result to the user.

## **Training and Results**
We train the deep convolutional neural network model on **GOOGLE COLAB** and **Microsoft Azure virtual machine** on 33,616 images and tested it on 8404 images and the accuracy achieved is 98% train, 90% validation and 75% testing."

**Facial Expression Recognition (FER)**
Facial expression recognition (FER) is a significant task for the machines to Understand the emotional changes in human beings. However, accurate hand-crafted features that are highly related to changes in expression are difficult to extract because of the influences of individual difference and variations in emotional intensity. Therefore, features that can accurately describe the changes in facial expressions are urgently required.

**Pre-processing Approaches**
Several pre-processing approaches, such as face detection, rotation rectification, and data augmentation, are implemented to restrict the regions for FER.

**Expression Related Features**
Expression-related features of facial grayscale images are extracted by fine-tuning a partial VGG16 network, the parameters of which are initialized using VGG16 model trained on ImageNet database.

**Final Recognition Results**
The result of final recognition is calculated using SoftMax classification. Results: Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm can recognize six basic facial expressions (happiness, sadness, anger, disgust, fear, and surprise) with high accuracy."

According to Statistics, every five seconds a person in the world becomes blind, and the number of blind people around the world is estimated at 75 million. Most blind people have problems doing their daily activities like paying money or walking in the streets, knowing the right transport to ride, etc. New technologies appeared in the fields of image processing and computer vision where it was possible to recognize faces, detect objects, etc., and based on this, we can help the blind in an effective way and find solutions to their simple everyday problems.

## **Proposed System**
In This work, we proposed a developing support system for blind people to help them in their daily life routine and facilitate their activities using smart glasses. The most important features of this system are the possibility of identifying a human face, recognizing the current currency, and describing the humans if the blind person doesn't know him. In the preprocessing phase, the captured images are filtered using different digital filters as Gaussian filter. Additionally, extract the distinctive features to classify these images. More deep learning models are examined in the classification phase as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), VGG Network, Inception Network, etc. For the human face recognition, the best average accuracy reach 93.75% using Convolutional Neural Network. Additional to, the Face Description process accuracy reach 90% using Convolutional Neural Network. Finally, the current currency recognition process accuracy reaches 96.5% using Inception Network.

**Introduction**
Vision is a beautiful gift to humans. This paper aims to develop a ""Smart Cap"" is designed to help the blind people to move independently. These kinds of inventions consider a solution to motivate blind people to travel despite all their difficulties. Its main objective is to develop a new way of movement for blind people and facilitate their actions. The first task of the cap is to scan any scene, detect objects and convert it into audio text, so the person will listen to the audio through a headphone that's connected to the cap. The second task is to detect the whole faces by pressing a button that is connected to the cap as well.

**Technical Details**
The cap used many technologies to perform its tasks which are SSD, Viola Jones and LBPH. Detecting the object in the scene was done using the OpenCV and Single Shot Detector technology (SSD) with Efficient and Accurate Scene Detector. In order to convert the text into speech, it used Text to Speech technology (gTTS). The cap is provided by camera that relates to Raspberry Pi which is used to measure the required distance between the user and the object that has a descripted scene to be able to detect objects clearly. The scene will be described when the user presses the button. All the computing and processing operations were done using the Raspberry Pi and Camera.

**System Support and Future Plans**
Our system supports is a closed loop control system that continuously monitors the presence of any object around it and feedbacks the output to input for comparison. For the result, the combination of using SSD with Viola Jones detector provide really high accuracy which showed the ability of the cap to detect and recognize almost 99% of the scene and people. However, the cap has some drawbacks such as: supporting only the English language and the maximum distance of capturing the frame is between 40-150 cm. As a future plan, it is possible to support many languages and enhance emotion recognition, text to speech for books."

**Introduction: Concerns and Reasons for Missing Persons**
Being out of touch with a loved one is concerning, but during times of political dysfunction, violence, and natural disasters, not hearing from someone you care about is terrifying [1]. People go missing from their families and friends for various reasons. One of the prominent reasons is natural disasters of high intensity. Other reasons why one can be missing are abduction, psychological problems and criminal offences.

**Project Aim and Solution**
The aim of this project is to overcome the weaknesses in the current system of searching for missing people in Egypt, with the interest to offer a more significant solution. For this reason, we developed a unified portal that would help the police and the public by accelerating the process of searching using face recognition. When a person goes missing, the people related to that person, or the police can upload the picture of the person which will get stored in the database. When the public encounters a suspicious person, they can capture and upload the picture of that person into our portal. The face recognition model in our system will try to find a match in the database with the help of face encodings. It is performed by comparing the face encodings of the uploaded image to the face encodings of the images in the database. If a match is found, the system will automatically acquire a DNA verification test to validate the paternity relationship type. In such a test, the DNA profile of both sides will be statistically measured of how strongly a match signifies paternity.

**System Evaluation and Accuracy**
After the development and evaluation of the system, it's evident that this method will significantly improve and enhance the process of reuniting missing people with their friends and family. The face recognition model that we have used achieved an accuracy of 99.6% on the Labelled Faces in the Wild Benchmark which comprises 13,000 images.

## **Missing Children Statistics**
An estimated 8 million children are reported missing each year around the world. Of that number, according to the latest U.S. Department of Justice research, an estimated 800,000 children will go missing in the United States. Among the missing child cases a large percentage of children remain untraced.

## **Project Proposal**
This project proposes a program that would help the police and the public by accelerating the process of searching using finger print recognition and face recognition.

## **System Workflow**
When a person goes missing, the people related to that person or the police can upload the picture of the person and his/her finger print which will get stored in the database. When the public encounter a suspicious child, they can capture and upload the picture of that child and his/her finger print into our program. The photo will be automatically compared with the registered photos of the missing child from the database and try to find a match. For this, We used a pre-trained dlib model network trained by Davis King on a dataset of ~3 million images.

## **Image Encoding and Matching**
It is performed by comparing the face encodings of the uploaded image to the face encodings of the images in the database. If a match is found, it will be notified to the police and the people related to that person along with the location of where the person is found.

## **Fingerprint Recognition**
Recognition of the input child finger print is performed and finger print with more than 0.48 Match precent will be chosen from it if there is multiple the program will select the highest from the database of missing children fingerprints.

## **Face Recognition Model Accuracy**
The face recognition model that we have used maintains an accuracy of 99.38% on the standard Labeled Faces in the Wild benchmark dataset, which was trained from scratch on a dataset of about 3 million faces.

## **Introduction: Student Academic Performance**
Student academic performance at universities is crucial for education management systems. Students cannot choose the appropriate courses which are suitable for their interests, skills, and preferences. This choice affects them badly and lead to their failure.

## **Objective of Research Project**
The objective of our research project is two folded, First, our research project aims to help student to select suitable courses to improve his/her performance. Second, our research project intents to help the coordinator in courses registration process to make the best benefit of the data available in the educational database for the purpose of improving students' performance.

## **Methodology**
In order to achieve this objective, First, our research project will analyze the educational database to conclude the courses that help in improving students' GPA by the end of the semester and predict their results based on previous semesters' performance. Second, during courses registration process, our research project brings out the hidden knowledge from educational database to recommend to the program coordinator the most suitable course that cope with students abilities.

## **Algorithms and Performance Prediction**
Many algorithms are used to improve, predict student's performance and assist tutors to predict future trends and behavior of students in the next semester's courses. The results can be used to identify dropout students or help students choose the elective courses which are appropriate for them, but they require large storage space, restricted to one output attribute, do not give accurate results in some cases where there exists dependency among variables and they are not applicable for categorical data.

## **High Utility Mining (HUM) Algorithm**
In this project, High Utility Mining (HUM) algorithm is used. HUM balances between quantities and benefits is used. It identifies the item sets that have utility values equal or above a given utility minimum threshold. So, this prediction will help identifying the weak students and guiding them to be aware of their level early and help them select most suitable course to improve their results to avoid failure.

## **C2 Framework Definition**
C2 Framework refers to command and control framework, c2 framework helps pentesters and red teamers in their engagement on the targeted system to make the compromised system more secure by finding vulnerabilities in the system and report it to them.

## **Cyber Security Evolution**
Recent years, the cyber security fields have witnessed the evolution of antivirus and EDRs that made attacking on the system more difficult but with evolution of the antivirus and EDRs, the attacks also evolved and that include c2 frameworks, c2 framework provide everything the attacker need. The problem is, it's too expensive to buy for the small or medium companies, even the cheap ones or the free ones they have problems in making the connection stable between the target and the attacker ,so as long the connection isn't stable the persistent on the targeted machine will be merely impossible, also it gets detected by antiviruses and EDRs, so it doesn't provide the stealthiness that the attacker need.

## **Control and Command Framework**
This control and command framework overcome on all the previous problems that we mentioned earlier as it provide stability in communications and provide to pentesters and red teamers all the capabilities they need in order to perform their engagements.

## **Command and Control Framework Tools**
Command and control framework is the set of tools and techniques that attackers use to maintain communication with compromised devices following initial exploitation. The specific mechanisms vary greatly between attacks, but C2 generally consists of one or more covert communication channels between devices in a victim organization and a platform that the attacker controls .These communication channels are used to issue instructions to the compromised devices, download additional malicious payloads, and pipe stolen data back to the adversary."

**PCR Technique Overview**
The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a relatively simple technique that amplifies a DNA template to produce specific DNA fragments in vitro. Traditional methods of cloning a DNA sequence into a vector and replicating it in a living cell often require days or weeks of work, but amplification of DNA sequences by PCR requires only hours. While most biochemical analyses, including nucleic acid detection with radioisotopes, require the input of significant amounts of biological material, the PCR process requires very little. Thus, PCR can achieve more sensitive detection and higher levels of amplification of specific sequences in less time than previously used methods. These features make the technique extremely useful, not only in basic research, but also in commercial uses, including genetic identity testing, forensics, industrial quality control and in vitro diagnostics. Basic PCR is commonplace in many molecular biology labs where it is used to amplify DNA fragments and detect DNA or RNA sequences within a cell or environment."

**Background**
Over the years, bacteria has been considered as a reason for many diseases, in which only about 5% of them is considered pathogenic. Also, the bacterial genome evolves as a way of defense, so the biologists in the lab face hard challenges to know which bacteria causes the diseases and identify its type (pathogenic or not). However, the traditional ways to detect the bacteria types cost a lot of time and money.

**Objective**
Knowing the bacteria type and its species helps to diagnose the type of the disease and find a suitable treatment for it.

**Proposed Solution**
We believe that machine learning can help biologists identify bacteria types easily even if they evolve their genome sequence.

**Project Description**
In this project we develop a bacteria classification system using deep learning with convolutional neural network that can identify bacteria sequence features. The system should classify the sequence according to the bacteria database.

**Results**
We train the deep convolutional neural network model (CNN) on (18,367) sequences and tested it on (4,263) sequences and the accuracy achieved is (0.887) train, (0.868) validation."

**Introduction to Skin Diseases**

Skin diseases are more common than other diseases. Skin diseases may be caused by fungal infection, bacteria, allergy, or viruses, etc. The advancement of lasers and Photonics based medical technology has made it possible to diagnose the skin diseases much more quickly and accurately. But the cost of such diagnosis is still very expensive and limited. So, image processing techniques help us to build applicatons for dermatology at an initial stage. The extraction of features plays a key role in helping to classify skin diseases.

**Deep Learning and Skin Disease Detection**

Deep learning has a role in the detection of skin diseases in a variety of techniques. This work contributes in the research of skin disease detection. We proposed a deep learning-based method to detect skin diseases. This method takes the digital image of the patient effected skin area, then use image analysis to identify the type of disease. Our proposed approach is simple, fast and does not require expensive equipment other than a smart phone with a camera. The approach works on an image sent by the patient then the system extract features using pretrained or customized deep learning techniques. Features are being classified using convolutional neural network. Finally, the results are shown to the user, the type of the disease. Our app doesn't eliminate the necessity for doctors as their roles are indispensable at the moment.

**Introduction**
Efficiency of a planned site layout is essential for the successful completion of construction projects. Despite considerable research undertaken for optimizing construction site layouts, most models developed for this purpose have neglected the mutual impacts of the site layout and construction operation variables and are unable to thoroughly model these impacts.

**Framework Outline**
This paper outlines a framework enabling planners to anticipate site layout variables (i.e., size, location, and orientation of temporary facilities) and construction plan variables (e.g., resources and material delivery plan), and simultaneously optimize them in an integrated model. In this framework, genetic algorithm (GA) and simulation are integrated; GA heuristically searches for the near-optimum solution with minimum costs by generating feasible candidate solutions, and simulation mimics construction processes and measures the project costs by adopting those candidate solutions.

**Contribution**
The contribution of this framework is the ability to capture the mutual impacts of site layout and construction plans in a unified simulation model and optimize their variables in GA, which subsequently entails developing a more efficient and realistic plan.

**System Results**
The final result of our system is that our project range the facilities in their right position,,and check if their overlapping between facilities or not.

**Conclusion**
We do all of these and make sure that every facility in a place which there is no overlapping with the other and minimize distance, time of transport, and cost.

## **Universal Acceptance Definition**

Universal Acceptance (UA) is the state where all valid domain names and email addresses are accepted, validated, stored, processed, and displayed correctly and consistently by all Internet-enabled applications, devices, and systems.

## **Importance of Universal Acceptance**

Universal Acceptance is a foundational requirement for a truly multilingual Internet, one in which users around the world can navigate entirely in local languages. It is also the key to unlocking the potential of new generic top-level domains (gTLDs) to foster competition, consumer choice and innovation in the domain name industry. To achieve Universal Acceptance, Internet applications and systems must treat all TLDs in a consistent manner, including new gTLDs and internationalized TLDs.

## **Challenges with Current Systems**

Many systems run under the presupposition that all domain names and their e-mail addresses are only available in ASCII and that TLDs are restricted to a well-defined and constant two or three characters which led to the inability for prodigious amount of people to not exploit of the internet services. In any community, people become ill and require access to healthcare facilities and treatments and these facilities should be at one's fingertips when needed. Due to existence of billions of users who may speak different languages, they might not know how to get the healthcare facilities effortlessly due to lack of freedom to choose the online identity.

## **Universally Accepted Healthcare System**

Universally Accepted Healthcare System ensures that the assumptions mentioned are no longer valid. Individuals can now experience the Internet fully by their preferred language. The system fits all social levels without any discrimination towards the language.

## **Benefits for Users**

Moreover, user will be able to follow up his health issues with his preferable doctor which could be based on his rating or even his location. Furthermore, user can now book his doctor appointment by just a blink of an eye. Users remembering their children next vaccine is no longer an issue as there will be an e-mail sent to the parents before the vaccine day.

### **Video Compression Process**
Video Compression is a process of reducing the file size without degrading the video quality. This is achieved by reducing the redundancy between consecutive frames and within a single frame. Motion estimation is used to reduce temporal redundancy between frames by dividing the frame in to blocks and search for the best match according to the cost function. The proposed compression system uses the conventional red, green and blue color space representation and applies a two dimension discrete wavelet transform on the error residual signal before estimating the motion between frames.

### **Threshold and Quantization**
A value of threshold is assigned to the subband coefficients; a second of threshold is assigned to the second level detail subband coefficients. The second value is less than the first value. The resulting coefficients are quantized using a non-uniform quantizer and encoded using the EZW encoding algorithm.

### **System Testing and Parameters**
The system will be tested using two kinds of videos (simple, complex). The performance of the system will be tested by two main parameters; compression ratio(CR) and Peak signal to noise ratio(PSNR). All graphics and codes are executed using MATLAB2014a.

## **Introduction**

'The human brain is programmed to seek safety', safety means something different for each user. The application is an attempt to offer users the safest route available to his destination. When using any GPS applications, the fastest route is detected and displayed, regardless of the safety of this route.

## **Safety Aspects and Measurements**

The word ""safety"" here may have many different aspects and measurements and that's why it's very hard for any company to measure the safety of all routes worldwide and that's why we decided to develop the Safest Route Detector application. This application will depend on crowdsourcing to detect the route safety, if any problem faced the user he can make a report and select the problem that faced him, the reports will be saved to the database, with the report name, user name and problem type.

## **Route Retrieval and Database Check**

When any user request a route the system will retrieve a number of routes and then check the database to detect if there is any report that includes a street name that is included in the routes retrieve.

## **Weight Assignment and Problem Reporting**

Each route will be given a weight depending on the number of reports that are done on the streets included in it. The lower the route weight the more the system favors and recommend it to the user. the types of the problem that can be included in a report are : (no enough lights, not well constructed, no cars driving the same route, deserted, no phone signal ...etc ). Each user will also have a trusted account that will be notified in case the user is facing any trouble. This notification to the trusted account will include the username and the location of the user that needs help.

**Introduction**
The brain is the central control module and the most complex part in the human body. It's a primary receiver, organizer and distributor of the information for the body. Billions of neurons makeup the brain and work in coordination to introduce the multiple functions of the brain. Accordingly, it is a challenge to learn the brain and our knowledge is still limited.

**Neurogenomics**
Neurogenomics came to study the brain functions at a molecular level as it studied how the genome as a whole contributes to the evolution, development, structure and function of the nervous system. But still we worked on a whole tissue which is composed of multiple neuronal and non-neuronal cells.

**Single-Cell Technology**
Therefore, Single-Cell technology has made it more specific and possible to further extend the computational approaches, instead of measuring expression values on whole tissues. Thus, a better understanding of the molecular landscape can be developed.

**Pipeline Idea**
Our pipeline idea is to work on scRNA-seq data and identify species-specific biological features/types in brain cells."

## **Introduction**
Synthesizing real photos from face sketches or text and its inverse has many applications. However, sketch/photo or text/photo synthesis remains a challenging problem due to the fact that photo and sketch have different characteristics, also it is hard to generate high-resolution realistic images.

## **Proposed Architecture**
Two different architectures were implemented in this work that aims to generate realistic human face images from sketch images guided with text descriptions that can be very useful in CSI and police work to get a more plausible image of the suspects.

In this work, we propose SRHI, a novel architecture for text-guided sketch to realistic human face generation based on the recent state-of-the-art TediGAN framework. Our new architecture proved it can be used to produce diverse and high-quality images with a very high resolution at 1024. It also inherently supports image synthesis with multi-modal inputs such as sketch and text.

The proposed architecture consists mainly of three components: StyleGAN, STF Encoder, text-guided optimization process. The STF Encoder maps sketch images to the latent space of a well-trained StyleGAN. The intermediate latent code outputted by the STF Encoder enters the text-guided optimization process to give the final latent code which is then provided as an input to the well-trained StyleGAN to produce the final realistic image.

## **Comparison and Results**
TediGAN architecture pipeline is also implemented in order to compare the newly proposed architecture, SRHI, to the state-of-the-art methods. SRHI and TediGAN architectures are compared to each other in the STF and optimization parts separately as they are two totally different tasks and to get better insights on what needs to be improved.

After a total of more than 5 experiments, discussed in chapter 5 we managed to apply a better optimization process that got + 0.008 LPIPS than state-of-the-art TediGAN that got +0.121 LPIPS and increased the performance of the overall system. Having better results than many recent existing methods that only tackles STF problem which usually have blurred and unclear image outputs, but less good results than state-of-the-art pSp, probably due to insufficient training for the implemented models.

## **Introduction to Style Transfer**
This paper introduces a deep-learning approach to photographic style transfer that handles a large variety of image content while faithfully transferring the reference style. Rendering the semantic content of an image in different styles is a difficult image processing task. Arguably, a major limiting factor for previous approaches has been the lack of image representations that explicitly represent semantic information and, thus, allow to separate image content from style.

## **Neural Algorithm for Artistic Style**
Here we use image representations derived from Convolution Neural Networks optimized for object recognition, which make high level image information explicit. We introduce A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style that can separate and recombine the image content and style of natural images. The algorithm allows us to produce new images of high perceptual quality that combine the content of an arbitrary photograph with the appearance of numerous well-known artworks. Our results provide new insights into the deep image representations learned by Convolution Neural Networks and demonstrate their potential for high level image synthesis and manipulation.

## **Neural Style Transfer Research**
Extensive research in neural style transfer methods has shown that the correlation between features extracted by a pre-trained VGG network has remarkable ability to capture the visual style of an image.

**Introduction to Intensive Care**
Taking care of patients in intensive Care Units is strenuous and nerve racking because the possibilities of losing the patient so the doctors need to give priority for patients with higher risk of mortality and to do so doctors need the continuous observation of the different patients' stats through various vital signals and medical analysis but it's time and energy consuming resulting to the risk of untimely care.

**The Need for AI in ICU**
we need an Al to predict mortality of patients in ICU, to give priority to the patients with higher risk of mortality.

**ICU Environment and Patient Care**
Intensive care unit (ICU) is a ward in hospital, where seriously ill patients are cared for by specially trained staff. Quick and accurate decisions for the patients are needed. As a result, a wide range of decision support systems have been deployed to aid intensivists for prioritizing the patients who have a high risk of mortality. Most mortality prediction systems are considered as score-based models which appraise disease severity to predict an outcome. These models utilize patient demographics and physiological variables such as age, temperature, and heart rate collected within the initial 12 to 24 hours after ICU admission with the aim of assessing ICU performance. The score-based models employ certain features that sometimes are not available at ICU admission. Also, they make decisions according to a collection of data after at least first 12 hours of ICU admission. To enhance the proficiency"

## **Problem Statement**
Every year many people lose their lives due to fatal road accidents around the world and drowsy driving is one of the primary causes of road accidents and death. Fatigue and micro sleep at the driving controls are often the root cause of serious accidents. However, initial signs of fatigue can be detected before a critical situation arises and therefore, detection of driver's fatigue and its indication is ongoing research topic. Most of the traditional methods to detect drowsiness are based on behavioral aspects while some are intrusive and may distract drivers, while some require expensive sensors. Therefore, in this paper, a light-weight, real time driver's drowsiness detection system is developed and implemented on Android application. 

## **Proposed Solution and Results**
The system records the videos and detects driver's face in every frame by employing image processing techniques. The system is capable of detecting facial landmarks, computes Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) and Eye Closure Ratio (ECR) and the case of Mouths to detect driver's drowsiness based on cases Machine learning algorithms have been employed to test the efficacy of the proposed approach. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed model is able to achieve accuracy up to 90% using Deep learning.

Chunk: ""Academic warning - dismissal from study - mechanisms of raising the cumulative average
1. The student is given an academic warning if he obtains a cumulative average less than ""2"" for any semester that he must raise his cumulative average to at least 2.00.
2. A student who is academically probated is dismissed from the study if the GPA drops below 2.00 is repeated during six main semesters.
3. If the student does not meet the graduation requirements within the maximum period of study, which is double the years of study according to the law, he will be dismissed.
4. The College Council may consider the possibility of granting the student exposed to dismissal as a result of his inability to raise his cumulative average to At least one and final chance of two semesters to raise his/her GPA to 2.00 and meet graduation requirements if he/she has successfully completed at least 80% of the credit hours required for graduation.
5. The student may re-study the courses in which he has previously passed in order to improve the cumulative average, and the repetition is a study and an exam, and the grade he obtained the last time he studied the course is calculated for him. A maximum of (5) courses unless the improvement is for the purpose of raising the academic warning or achieving the graduation requirements, and in all cases, both grades are mentioned in his academic record.
6. For the student to re-study a course in which he has previously obtained a grade of (F), the grade he obtained in the repetition is calculated with a maximum of (B), and for calculating the cumulative average, the last grade is calculated for him only, provided that both grades are mentioned in the student's academic record."""
