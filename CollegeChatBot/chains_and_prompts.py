        The four data sources are, in this specific order:
        1. Abstracts: Contains summaries and details of student graduation projects and research.
        2. Emails: Contains contact information (email addresses, departments) for college doctors and staff.
        3. Finals: Contains links to past final exam papers for various courses.
        4. Rules: Contains official college regulations, academic rules, course prerequisites, and program structures.
        You will be given:
        1. The User's Question.
        2. A Sample Snippet from each of the four data sources to help you understand the type of information each contains.
        Your goal is to output a Python list of 4 integers. Each integer represents the estimated number of relevant documents that should be retrieved from the corresponding data source to answer the question. The order in the list MUST match the order of the data sources listed above: [number_for_Abstracts, number_for_Emails, number_for_Finals, number_for_Rules]
        Guidelines for determining the number of documents:
        * Relevance is Key: If a data source is highly relevant and likely to contain the core answer, suggest 1-3 documents. For broader queries requiring exploration (e.g., "find projects about AI"), you might suggest up to 10 from 'Abstracts'.
        * Specificity:
            * 
            * If the question asks for a single piece of specific information (e.g., "email of Dr. Smith"), 1 or 2  document from the 'Emails' source is likely sufficient.
            * If the question asks about multiple specific items (e.g., "final exams for CS101 for 2020, 2021, and 2022"), you might suggest 1-3 documents from 'Finals', assuming each year/course might be a separate document or closely related ones.
        * Irrelevance: If a data source is clearly irrelevant to the question, use 0 for that source.
        * Conciseness: Prefer fewer documents if the answer is likely to be found in a small number of highly relevant chunks. Avoid requesting many documents unnecessarily.
        * No Information: If you believe none of the data sources can answer the question, you can output [0, 0, 0, 0].
        Example Scenarios:
        * Question: "What is Dr. Eman Hamdi's email address?"
            * 
            * Expected Output Reasoning: This is a direct request for an email. 'Emails' is the only relevant source.
            * Expected Output: [0, 1, 0, 0]
        * Question: "Can you show me some graduation project abstracts on machine learning?"
            * 
            * Expected Output Reasoning: This is about project abstracts. 'Abstracts' is primary. A few examples would be good.
            * Expected Output: [3, 0, 0, 0] (Suggesting 3 abstracts)
        * Question: "Where can I find the final exam for Algorithms from 2021 and what are the prerequisites for the advanced algorithms course?"
            * 
            * Expected Output Reasoning: Needs 'Finals' for the exam link and 'Rules' for course prerequisites.
            * Expected Output: [0, 0, 1, 1] (or [0, 0, 1, 2] if prerequisites are complex and might span multiple rule chunks)
        * Question: "What are the college's rules regarding plagiarism and what's the email for the head of the CS department?"
            * 
            * Expected Output Reasoning: Needs 'Rules' for plagiarism and 'Emails' for the department head.
            * Expected Output: [0, 1, 0, 1]

        **Abstract**
        
        During the last few decades, with the rise of Youtube, Amazon, Netflix and many other such web services, recommender systems have taken more and more place in our lives. From e-commerce (suggest to buyers articles that could interest them) to online advertisement (suggest to users the right contents, matching their preferences), recommender systems are today unavoidable in our daily online journeys.
        
        **Recommender Systems as Algorithms**
        
        In a very general way, recommender systems are algorithms aimed at suggesting relevant items to users (items being movies to watch, text to read, products to buy or anything else depending on industries).
            
        2. Sample from 'Emails' Data Source:
              Dr. Eman Hamdi is part of the Unknown department and can be reached at emanhamdi@cis.asu.edu.eg.
